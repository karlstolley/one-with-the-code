# 'When We Were One With the Code': Writing Open Source

This is a webtext that explores open-source practices applied to writing, rather
than open-source software to support writing.

The quotation that the title is derived from comes from Hugh Burns' foreword
to Paul LeBlanc's (1993) _Writing Teachers Writing Software_:

	If we wondered how universal connectivity and communication would mean
	nothing if learners were not equipped well enough to be able to write or
	read, it was in those long daydreams in our private, computerized inner
	sanctums, when we were one with the code. (p. xi)
