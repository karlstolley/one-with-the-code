A fundamentally flawed if unspoken assumption in computers and writing is that multimodal expression necessitates multimodal tools. That is how Microsoft Word in particular seems to have closed down the line of inquiry in LeBlanc (1993); it is significant that Microsoft Word 6.0 arrived in 1993, 6.0 being the first version available on all three of the major operating systems of that time (MS-DOS, Windows, and Mac OS)--and also the last version of Word for MS-DOS. And with the release of Windows 95, MS-DOS was no longer a standalone product, but rather integrated with Windows itself, arguably closing out the era of command-line interaction (and therefore written acts) with computers for most users.
